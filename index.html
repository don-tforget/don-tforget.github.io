For my Myers-Briggs test I found out I’m an ENFP (Campaigner) and from my learning style test I found out I’m more of a Visual learner than anything else. Lastly, for my Big Five Personality test I scored O: 85%, C: 54%, E: 71%, A: 81% and N: 33%.</p><p><a href = "http://suzycato.github.io">Ryan's website</a>

I don't have any professional IT experience however i did do 3 years of IT in high school mainly consisting of multimedia work and website building. My personality quiz result gave me “Virtuosso” someone who is highly skilled in music or just art in general, with my learning style quiz i received “auditory learner” meaning i learn through listening rather than doing.

								<p>Ryan: Javascript developer in Japan<br>Peter: Travelling freelancer<br>Shieerl: Application developer<br>Nicholas: Programmer<br>Wenjie Fan (Oliver): Unity developer<br></p>
								<p>Collectively, there is a similarity between each group members ideal job, to work in IT. Similarly, we would all like flexibility with our working hours and good work-life balance. The main difference between our jobs is that we want to work in different departments and locations. Some of us would prefer to work either overseas, with computers (Javascript developer, Programmer) with devices (Application developer) or even with both (Unity developer, Freelancer). We have an all-rounded team because of this.</p>
								<p>The main thing that differentiates a Javascript developer from the rest of the ideal jobs is that they’ll be working with main computers (compared to devices) and mainly creating with Java. They won’t have too much interaction with users/customers and will be more in touch with the investors instead. A Javascript developer might have a little in common with a programmer because of the same core concepts behind programming but it’s all dependent on the programming language. Maybe Nicholas and I will work together in the future :”)</p>
								<p>The main thing that differentiates a freelancer from the rest of the jobs is predominantly the freedom the job, or jobs, will afford me. As there will not be any specific location I will have to be present in and no fixed job hours i will need to attend, my working experience will essentially be determined by myself only. This will allow me to have a very flexible work life and an ideal work to life balance, which, to that level, is unique to the freelancer job.
</p>
								<p>The main thing that differentiates an application developer from the rest of the ideal jobs is that it is mainly focus on designing, developing and testing an application. There will be an interaction with the customer as we need feedbacks from them in order to make the application better and satisfy what user needs. The work can actually be done at home, it does not necessary have to be in the office, which means that I will have flexible work time.</p>
								<p>NICHHHH</p>
								<p>The main thing that differentiates a unity developer from the rest of the ideal jobs is that the unity is a game engine which provides a platform for most game enthusiast who is interested to create a self-made game, which means it could be identified as a game developer job while the rest ideal jobs are for academic study. But all of them are a part of IT, working in the same way(programming language) to service people. </p>

								<div style="page-break-after: always;"><p>Ryan: Javascript developer in Japan<br>Peter: Travelling freelancer<br>Shieerl: Application developer<br>Nicholas: Programmer<br>Wenjie Fan (Oliver): Unity developer<br></p></div>
								<p>The main similarity between our jobs is that we all want to work in IT but the major difference between our jobs is where we want to work. Most of us don’t mind working in Australia but some of us want to either work in another country or be able to travel and work at the same time. Alongside this, some of us would prefer to work with computers (Javascript developer, Programmer) whilst some of us would instead like to work with devices instead (Application developer).</p>
								<p>Overall, our ideal jobs are pretty well-rounded. We have mainly computer-based jobs (Java Developer, Programmer, Freelancer), a mobile-based job (Application Developer) and a computer + mobile-based job (Unity Developer). With all of this this in mind, our project idea looks like a much more straightforward task as our group consists of many types of people with all types of skills. Alongside this, we can all contribute to our project idea (which is an app) because we all have an interest in an area of IT that usually works with apps anyway. It’s really good that we all have a big common interest in IT itself with most of us being really interested in different types of programming languages. This means that we’ll all be willing to jump into the unknown and even learn a bit of programming and other app-development related things for when it comes to making our group app.</p>
