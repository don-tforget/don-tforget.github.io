For my Myers-Briggs test I found out I’m an ENFP (Campaigner) and from my learning style test I found out I’m more of a Visual learner than anything else. Lastly, for my Big Five Personality test I scored O: 85%, C: 54%, E: 71%, A: 81% and N: 33%.</p><p><a href = "http://suzycato.github.io">Ryan's website</a>

I hobbies include listening to music and watching tv shows, My main interest in IT would be programming as i love watching a project be built, functional and solving problems. I don't have any professional IT experience however i did do 3 years of IT in high school mainly consisting of multimedia work and website building. My personality quiz result gave me “Virtuosso” someone who is highly skilled in music or just art in general, with my learning style quiz i received “auditory learner” meaning i learn through listening rather than doing. Finally my behavioural quiz i received “controller” someone that takes leadership in group situations and delegates tasks. </p><p><a href = "https://nicholasjamou1.github.io/">Nicholas's website</a>

My I.T interests revolve primarily around Programming and website development at the moment however my skills and experience surrounding these fields are limited. My Myers-Briggs test results returned with a commander personality type referencing me to the likes of steve jobs and other napoleon. My online learning style test came back with equal levels for each of the learning styles except with tactile that had a 10 percent increase in learning efficiency. My Big five personality test also came up with the results that i have an inclination to speak my mind openly and can efficiently convey my ideas and thoughts about topics, the results also showed an openness and understanding of other people’s point of views. </p><p><a href = "https://pete-zamba.github.io/">Peter's website</a>

								<h2 class="major">Team Profile</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Our group consists of an ENFP (Campaigner), two ISFJ-Ts (Defenders), a ISTP-A (Virtuoso) and an ENTJ (Commander).</p>
								<p><b>Ryan (ENFP):</b> I believe the results from my tests will be useful for my group when it comes to handing out workloads and determining what I should work on. I like to be creative and open to anything in my work so I think if I worked on designs or possible even some coding aspects of our group work then I would perform best. Alongside this, because I am a visual learner, I think it would be better if I got my instructions through a way other than telling me face to face.</p>
								<p><b>Nicholas (ISTP-A, Virtuoso):</b> The results from the 16personalities test describes me as someone who loves to explore and “examine the world around them”. My personality would benefit the team because virtuosos enjoy hearing other ideas and don't like when everyone agrees with each other, which would spark discussion of ideas and design choices.</p>
								<p><b>Shieerl (ISFJ-T, Defender):</b> The results from this test show that i like to give attention to small details & have analytical ability. I believe that it is useful when it comes to group assignment like this as i will pay attention to the detail that my other team members might have forgot to add and analyze the works.</p>
								<p><b>Peter (ENTJ, Commander):</b> These results for me show that I have a willingness or at the very least a capability to take control of a situation and organise or orient myself efficiently in a way that I believe to be efficient. In a group setting this would indicate that I may attempt to organise and lead the team to reach our set goals. Based on these results, it indicates that I should be okay in most group leadership roles however in a position with bad leadership and bad management I may appear to rebel against the leader as I cannot stand for inefficient management.</p>
								<p><b>Wenjie (ISFJ-A / ISFJ-T):</b> The results from the feedback show that I will try my best to finish my work on time as hard as I can, but I am a little procrastinating. So I will not let my partners down and also I am a person who has a strong responsibility.</p>
								<p>We think this is a really good selection of personalities. Our commander is bold and strong-willed and will always find a way. He pairs really well with our enthusiastic and creative Campaigner because they’ll be able to get together and constantly pull out creative ideas. But of there’s something the Commander and Campaigner aren’t able to do, our Virtuoso will fill that slot. A master of all kinds of tools, our Virtuoso will always be around to help out and provide support with anything we might have trouble with. Finally, at the end of every decision we make, our two dedicated Defenders will be there to support us. With excellent analytical abilities, they’ll be able to see if we’re going in the right direction or if we’re steering away too much.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Jobs</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<div style="page-break-after: always;"><p>Ryan: Javascript developer in Japan<br>Peter: Travelling freelancer<br>Shieerl: Application developer<br>Nicholas: Programmer<br>Wenjie Fan (Oliver): Unity developer<br></p></div>
								<p>The main similarity between our jobs is that we all want to work in IT but the major difference between our jobs is where we want to work. Most of us don’t mind working in Australia but some of us want to either work in another country or be able to travel and work at the same time. Alongside this, some of us would prefer to work with computers (Javascript developer, Programmer) whilst some of us would instead like to work with devices instead (Application developer).</p>
								<p>Overall, our ideal jobs are pretty well-rounded. We have mainly computer-based jobs (Java Developer, Programmer, Freelancer), a mobile-based job (Application Developer) and a computer + mobile-based job (Unity Developer). With all of this this in mind, our project idea looks like a much more straightforward task as our group consists of many types of people with all types of skills. Alongside this, we can all contribute to our project idea (which is an app) because we all have an interest in an area of IT that usually works with apps anyway. It’s really good that we all have a big common interest in IT itself with most of us being really interested in different types of programming languages. This means that we’ll all be willing to jump into the unknown and even learn a bit of programming and other app-development related things for when it comes to making our group app.</p>
